            <p>IMDb's cookies allow you to take advantage of some of IMDb's essential features. For instance, if you block or otherwise reject our cookies, you will not be able to contribute content, review films, add items to your Watchlist, or use any IMDb Services that require you to sign in.</p>
            <p>Approved third parties may also set cookies when you interact with IMDb Services. Third parties include providers of measurement and analytics services, social media networks, ad networks, ad serving companies, and advertising companies. Third parties use cookies in the process of delivering content, including ads relevant to your interests, to measure the effectiveness of their ads, and to perform services on behalf of IMDb. They may automatically receive an IP address when this happens.</p>
            <p>You can manage browser cookies through your browser settings.

            <p><strong>Does IMDb Share Your Personal Information?</strong></p>
            <p>Information about our users is an important part of our business, and we are
    
     not in the business of selling our users' personal information to others. We share user information with our parent corporation (Amazon.com, Inc.), the subsidiaries it controls that follow practices at least as protective as those described in this Privacy Notice, and as described below.</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Transactions involving Third Parties</b>: We make available to you services provided by third parties. For example, you can purchase movie tickets from third parties through Showtimes &amp; Tickets. You can tell when a third party is involved in your transactions, and we share users' personal information related to those transactions with that third party.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Third-Party Service Providers</b>: We employ other companies and individuals to perform functions on our behalf. Examples include processing payments, removing repetitive information from user lists, analyzing data, providing marketing assistance, and transmitting content. They have access to personal information needed to perform their functions, but may not use it for other purposes.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Business Transfers</b>: As we continue to develop our business, we might sell or buy other businesses or services. In such transactions, user information generally is one of the transferred business assets but remains subject to the promises made in any pre-existing Privacy Notice (unless, of course, the user consents otherwise). Also, in the unlikely event that IMDb.com, Inc. or substantially all of its assets are acquired, user information will of course be one of the transferred assets.
              </li>
              <li>
                <b>Protection of IMDb and Others</b>: We release account and other personal information when we believe release is appropriate to comply with the law; enforce or apply our <a href="https://www.imdb.com/conditions">Conditions of Use</a> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of IMDb, our users, or others. This includes exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection and credit risk reduction.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>Other than as set out above, you will receive notice when personal information about you might be shared with third parties, and you will have an opportunity to choose not to share the information.</p>
            <p><strong>What About Advertising?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <b>Third-Party Advertising and Links to Other Websites:</b> IMDb Services may include third-party advertising and links to other websites and apps. Third-party advertising partners may collect information about you when you interact with their content, advertising, and services. For more information about third-party advertising at IMDb, including interest-based ads, please read the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=202075050">Amazon Interest-Based Ads</a> policy. To adjust your advertising preferences, please go to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacyprefs?ref_=footer_iba">Your Ads Privacy Choices</a> page.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Use of Third-Party Advertising Services:</strong> We provide ad-serving companies, ad networks, and advertising companies with information that allows them to serve you with more useful and relevant ads and to measure their effectiveness. We never share your name or other information that directly identifies you when we do this. Instead, we use an advertising identifier like a cookie or other device identifier. For example, we may share a cookie or advertising identifier together with a request to deliver an advertisement with an ad network to enable you to receive more relevant ads. As an additional example, if you have already downloaded one of our apps, we will share your advertising identifier and data about that event so that you will not be served an ad to download the app again. Some ad companies also use this information to serve you relevant ads from other advertisers. You can learn more about how to opt-out of personalized advertising (such as cross-context behavioral advertising) by going to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/privacyprefs?ref_=footer_iba">Your Ads Privacy Choices</a> page.</p>
            <p><strong>How Secure Is Information About Me?</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                We work to protect the security of your personal information during transmission by using encryption protocols and software.
              </li>
              <li>
                We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards in connection with the collection, storage, and disclosure of personal customer information. Our security procedures mean that we may occasionally request proof of identity before we disclose personal information to you.
              </li>
              <li>
                It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your password and to your computers, devices, and applications. We recommend using a unique password for your IMDb account that is not used for other online accounts. Be sure to sign off when finished using a shared computer.

                Most devices provide users with the ability to change device permissions (e.g., disable/access location services).

                <p><strong>Children's Privacy</strong></p>
                <p>IMDb Services are not directed to individuals under the age of 13, and we do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13 years of age. If you are under 13, please do not submit any personal information through IMDb Services. If you have reason to believe that a child under the age of 13 has provided personal information to IMDb, please contact us, and we will promptly delete that information from our databases.</p>
                <p><strong>California Privacy Rights</strong></p>
                <p>California law permits users who are California residents to request and obtain from us once a year, free of charge, a list of the third parties to whom we have disclosed their personal information (if any) for their direct marketing purposes in the prior calendar year, as well as the type of personal information disclosed to those parties.
